# How-to-copy-sim-card


Login to your target's email. Chances are their carrier is within the email.

STEP 2:
Call up the carrier customer service

    Tell them to email you a new 6 digit pin. Not difficult at all as most reps are based in Asia and couldn't give a toss.

    STEP 3:
    Once you’ve successfully changed the pin, you now need a second SIM pre paid or post paid.
    DO NOT port to a different carrier or they will request the IMEI.
    Swap to same carrier and they will transfer your victims number to your burner SIM once’s the 6 digit codes is verified.

    Contact the carrier and say "I'd like to transfer my old number to this account (burner), I'd like my old number back"
    They'll request for your target's number and pin.
    Once this has been done, you can now port it to a different carrier as you can identify the IMEI on your burner.
    Alternatively, you can do whatever that needs the OTP and keep it in the original carrier.
    Once finished, CHANGE the number as the victim will call up for a replacement once they realise they've been swapped. If you do this they cant because you've already changed the number and previous one won't exist. This will let you keep your SIM rather than buying a new
    one
